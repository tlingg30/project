Introduction:
The abyss game is a turn-based fighting game, where a player can fight other monsters in the game using one of his fours companions. Initially, the playerâ€™s monster will only have 2 fighting options (normal attack + critical attack). Later in the game  they can be upgraded to have third attack skill. Each victory will grant the player a certain amount of rewards (aka coins). The player can use them to level up their monsters to increase their strength and health. We can also save and load games (Maximum 2). To finish the game, the player will need to beat the level 10 boss.
